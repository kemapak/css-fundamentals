# Selectors
Selectors are identifiers for tags or HTML statements that has a curtain class or property. With CSS selectors we can 
easly style them. We are going to review types of selectors.

## Tag selectors (type/element selectors)
I can them tag selector because they directly apply to HTML or any markup languages (like XML) tag. The official name is
type or element selector. For example if we want to style all the `<div>` tags we can easily do as below. At this moment
do not worry what the properties are doing. We will cover that in detail later.

```css
div {
    color: green;
    background-color: black;
}
```

## Class selectors

## ID selectors
