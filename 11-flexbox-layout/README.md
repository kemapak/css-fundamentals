Most of the elements in HTML are in normal flow. The only was an element leaves normal flow is to be floated, positioned,
made into a flexbox, grid layout or table element.

**flex container**: `flex, inline-flex`
flex items: any child element of the flexbox.
flex-direction: `row|row-reverse|column|column-reverse`

default value is `row`, flexbox is not inherited.
