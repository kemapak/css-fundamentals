## What is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)?
CSS in other words, Cascading Style Sheets is one of member of web trinity along with HTML and JavaScript. These are the
core languages we use to create our web based application and sites. CSS is a programming language with a core purpose
and capability of styling our applications that use to create with markup languages like HTML, XML, MathML and so forth.
CSS is the language that styles how our applications look!

CSS is usually hated by web engineers because of its complex and mysterious behavior. It is very hard to build and fix
layouts, styles. That is mainly because the CSS of an application is build by people who does not understand and know
the language. By piling up crap you cannot expect a good outcome. To remedy this CSS pre-engines like SASS, LESS or very
powerful styling layout frameworks like BootStrap, Foundation, Tailwinds come to picture. I do recommend using one of
these frameworks instead of building your own. These frameworks are customizable to look like your design language. So
building one from scratch is usually very expensive, and maintain it is even more costly per time and resources
perspective.

CSS, JavaScript and HTML are very tightly coupled. This is usually a terrible thing in software engineering but because
of the nature of the web development this is expected, since the word web trinity comes from.

CSS need to know the structure of our HTML documents to apply or alter styles. Just getting generated CSS code from
applications that designers use does not help, actually most of the time they harm, because these tools do not have an
understanding of underlying design system and a CSS framework.

My recommendation is most engineers do not write CSS but learn these framework well, to style their applications. The
senior design team work with framework engineers to apply their design system to one of this layout frameworks.

Said that some of us need to know CSS, so this document is for them. A solid knowledge of HTML and semantic HTML tags  
is prerequisite for fully understand this documentation.

I will have additional separate documentation how to build a basic CSS framework and even a separate document that talks
about refactoring CSS.

## Short history of CSS
In old days we used to use `table` tags for page layout, `font` tags for fonts, and many more for some terrible stlying.
Anything was better than a gray, boring browser screen. CSS can to rescue, and changed everything. In 1994 1st proposal
for CSS standard was submitted. In 1996 CSS1 was published. CSS2 standard followed shortly in 1998, and finally in 2012
CSS3 or level 3 standard (in modules) was published. Nowadays browsers to update often to support the latest changes in CSS
standards.

## Running the code examples

This repository contains training classes for CSS fundamentals (CSS 3).

You can through the examples to understand the concepts as well as the new features of CSS.

Each section has a README file for more details about that specific topic of the language.

I did not have a server set for this documentation since for CSS we do not need one, and you can open the HTML files in
your file system. I do recommend using Chrome browser by Google and check other browsers if you want. Safari is even I do
love it has some major issues and not very developer friendly.

### Browser Developer Tools Shortcut for Browsers
```command+option+I```

You can use any modern Browser (Chrome is recommended) to go through the examples and try it yourself. **The only way we 
humans learn is by doing**, so make sure in addition to reading please write code and look at the example in browsers 
developers tools.
